## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Approach:

I approached the task with the general goal to create a new base UI which would:

1. Be a more professional base UI - that’s product agnostic - and conveys professionalism and therefore trustworthiness
2. … and act as a new base UI from which we can iterate and create new experiments

“Generic product(s)” can be physical/digital and so I wanted to centre the task on something that I didn’t have much knowledge about forcing me to be more fundamental about my approach and less bias.

I then asked myself:

1. “What product do I not necessarily use or have much knowledge about
2. … that is re-plenishable
3. … but doesn’t have a subscription model around 🤔?”

After much deliberation, I landed upon “athletic tape”

I was interchangeably reading about cognitive biases, pricing psychology, etc while trying to notice these patterns on other websites (i.e. momafoods.co.uk, Glossika.ai, bulk.com, minorfigures.com, etc).

After this I had a few mockup ideas and then decided to create a few different but fundamentally similar experiences to test against. (NOTE, I know this isn’t an experimental test but I thought it wouldn’t be any harm doing so).

## Key Features

Base UI:

- Images - generated by UI
  - If you look closely the image of the man wining the race has the athletic tape but the loser doesn’t. 😅
  - Combined social proof and direct quotes (NFL)
- Social proof in the form of reviews and quotes and a link to reviews within the plan section
  - Institutional trust from big organisations & annual user reviews further encourages annual subs
- Quality signals
  - Quick worded promotions such as “Vegan”, “EFAB approved (made up organisation)”, and bullet posted description with highlighted words signals quality
- Why use Tabs
  - I noticed that some websites encourage the user to move away from the ordering action buttons by placing descriptions/reviews/etc at different parts of the page. I felt it was important to keep everything as local to the tab as possible
  - This is also why I added a “order” button for mobile when the tabs are not visible to scroll down to it
- Simple price UI showing the before and after saving with quarterly reviews defaulted as an option.
  - While we want more revenue I think defaulting to annual may put off customers (this is just an hunch though

Differences in experiences:

One of the stand out things from my research was the use of segmenting priced users with their language and UI tricks. For example, a lot of sites have a “one time purchase” section with a subscription model next to it. Although this task doesn’t have a one time purchase option, we could treat monthly users as the equivalent which served as the idea to separate 3/4 experiences in my task with a simple dividing line. By separating it out and showing it first it makes the others look more cheaper and more “special”. (`is-segmented-omission` & `is-segmented-omission` & `is-segmented-badges`)

I wasn’t sure whether I could change the price for this task as a decoy but I instead chose to hide the savings of the monthly subscription entirely to make the other subscriptions feel like a no brainer cheaper option. (`is-segmented-omission` & `is-segmented-badges`)

The last experience `is-segmented-badges` was a more intentional push to sell with fancy badge icons & copy towards longer subscriptions. All but monthly also had additional benefits advertised such as “New tape samples” to separate them from just monthly plans. Also the “No Contract \* Cancel Anytime" text gives further incentive to sign up. The annual banner with the limited time badge also plays into the scarcity the user may feel, further encouraging annual sign ups.

## Biggest UX challenge - and the need to experiment

I was conflicting about reflecting price changes as the quantity was being toggled. I think this is arguably fundamentally a different problem but I also believe the less cognitively taxing the task is, the better. Therefore the total amount should be handled in the post-order button journey.

However, there is definitely room for this in an experimental format

## Event tracking

- I’ve created a little mini-tracking utility that logs the experience the user has and logs the on-click journey (i.e. tabs, etc). It also clears the logs when you select a new experience
- I’d be interested to see the user flow post clicking “order” particularly given the potential change in prices (quantity toggle).

## Technical Breakdown

This was a simple project and so I didn’t ponder too much on what technology I’d use. My go to tech stack is react with typescript. I also wanted to use this as a chance to try out a component library that uses tailwind. I went with `https://ui.shadcn.com/`.

The technical journey starts with a mock API call for dynamic data such as image urls, reviews, etc. At the app page level, this is called and waited upon with a loading spinner and error message to fallback on.

All the data is manipulated and managed in the DataProvider for ease of avoiding prop drilling and keeping my component structure more aligned with design (I LOVE context)

My shadcn components have a separate “UI” folder and any custom base components I wanted to make (based on them or not) would sit in a “base/component” folder. This was admittedly something I see as growing in complexity in the future and I’d combine these for scalability in the future - if I was to stick to the styles.

The components in app are related to the my page specific components

Testing here was limited to the 4 versions of the experience and the base UI structure of initial loading and error messaging.

## More time I would have …

- As mentioned experiment a bit more with the “order” part of the journey (i.e quantity/price changes being reflected)
- Add e2e tests
- Refactor out home into its own separate route like ‘/checkout’
- Added more differentiation in benefits between annual vs bi-annually vs quarterly
- While we want to gear users towards annual plans, I thought this may put off more users than we’d gain with quarterly this way but I’d look into this a bit more
- Added a bit more colouring and jazz up the website (even if its product agnostic)

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
